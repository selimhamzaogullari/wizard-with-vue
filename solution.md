### Solution

- I prefer to develop with Vuejs. Because I have been working with this framework for a long time.

- I collected my pages in App.js and checked the wizard with my page variable in the store.

- Since I will show the data on the last page, I have stored it in the store with the variable named 'allData'.

- I kept the total price in computed on page 3. I bought it before moving on to the next page, the price of which varies according to the package. And I wrote all this in my 'allData' variable in the store.
